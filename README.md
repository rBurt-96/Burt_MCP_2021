Hello! Attached here are the Python scripts used in the manuscript "Novel antibodies for the simple and efficient enrichment of native O-GlcNAc modified peptides". 
These scripts were used to interpret HexNAc fragment ion intensities from MS2 events generated by Protein Prospector in a Mascot generic format (mgf) file type.
These scripts were also used to match MS2 events in mgf files to PSMs found in Byos reports produced via Byonic.
To generate these mgf and Byos files, please refer to the methods section of the manuscript.

Included in the repository are example mgf and Byos files (fraction 3 of anti-O-GlcNAc enriched murine synaptosome).
